# Presentation
This is a temporary repo to provide reproducibility to the results presented in the paper "Meta-Learning-Based Selection of Classification Algorithm for Time Series". Here, you can find the code and files for meta-learning and tests. Before runing the Jupyter notebook, it is necessary to extract the meta-knowleedge using the run_pre_tsfresh.sh (Linux) or applying the pre_tsfresh.py for each data (in .tsv) in the directory 'data'.

The datasets are available at http://timeseriesclassification.com/dataset.php

Important note: this repo is temporalily simplified for review purposes. As soon as the paper gets accepted, the authors will update the repo with better documentation and codes to use the best meta-models.
